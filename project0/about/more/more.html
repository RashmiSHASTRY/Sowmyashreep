      reflexes,sharp teeth and retractable claws adapted to killing small prey. Its night vision and
      sense of smell are  well developed.

      Cat communication includes vocalizations like meowing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling
      and grunting as well as cat-specific body language. It is a solitary hunter but a social
      species.It can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those
      made by mice and other small mammals. It is a predator that is most active at dawn and dusk.
      It secretes and perceives pheromones.
